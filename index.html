                Hello! I'm Ryan Chapman, the creator of this website. I created this website so that I could exhibit my project design skills as well as my portfolio of other projects. I hope you can get to know me better both personally and professionally. Computers and programming have always interested me since I was little; as I grew up I decided I wanted to pursue this passion by obtaining a related degree. Now, I’m currently a second year student at UC Santa Cruz, pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering: Systems programming. I heavily enjoy my classes and projects I work on; I continue to love to code and try to soak up as much knowledge as possible when learning new languages and technologies. Right now, I’m searching for an internship for the Spring and Summer in 2024. So many different fields sound very interesting to me, I could see my future moving towards all sorts of different positions, software engineering, UI/UX development, DevOps, etc. I want a hands-on internship so I can narrow down my passion and what I want to focus on specifically. In general, I’m working towards gaining more experience and expanding my technical knowledge. In Spring 2024 I’m taking classes about Data Structures, Algorithms, and Statistics.            </div>
